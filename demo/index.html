            <h2>Slide 1</h2>
            <p>
                Press the digit keys on your keyboard to jumpy to different slides.

            <h2>Slide 2</h2>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad">numeric keypad</a> should work just as well as the digit keys abode the letters. I don't have a numpad/tenkey on my current keyboard, so that's just a rumor, for now.

                Look, someone is riding a zebra!

            <h2>Slide 4</h2>
            <p>
                I don't see any fence - do you?
            </p>

            <h2>Slide 5</h2>
            <p>
                Easter egg!

            <h2>Slide 6</h2>
            <p>
                The official description of this photo says they are jumping a fence.

            <h2>Slide 7</h2>
            <p>
                The photo was taken between 1890 and 1923.

            <h2>Slide 8</h2>
            <p>
                If you go to the US Library of Congress and ask really, really, nicely, I bet you can see the actual physical photo!
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Slide 9</h2>
            <p>
                Try and hit
                <kbd>End</kbd>
                and see if it takes you to the last slide!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Slide 10</h2>
            <p>
                It's only possible to jumpy to the first ten slides, by number. Please write a nice patch that listens for further digit keys, and jumps to slide 1, 12, 123 and so forth.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Slide 11</h2>
            <p>
                This is the last slide. Now try and hit
                <kbd>Home</kbd>
                and see if it takes you to the first slide!
            </p>
            <p>That's it, really. I was bored, and wanted to create a bespoke.js plugin. Enjoy!</p>
